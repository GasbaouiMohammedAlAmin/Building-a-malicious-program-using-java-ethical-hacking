# Build an advanced malicious program using java language for windows and linux platform

we will try to hide a malicious code into legal program.

this legal program has this features :

- beautiful design with graphical user interface.
- solve second degree equation.
- do all the operation(addition, subtraction , division and multiplication element by element) between two matrix.
- executed in any operation system platform .
- contains a malicious code without anyÂ suspect things.
- store data target into database without any suspect from target.
- interacts with the command shell

the data that was collected from the legal program ( mathematica ) are :
- public ip and local ip target.
- Host Mac Ethernet board.
- All interfaces network.
- All connected ip addresses from the target.
- Operating system info.
- All list process.
- Name of root user.
- Screenshot target.

# screenshot program hacker side

the mathematica program just for target side , we will also build another program (spy) for hacker side , which provide the attacker all news and data targets.

through this program the hacker can do :
- get a report about data targets.
- see the screenshot of targets.
- save data target into text file.
